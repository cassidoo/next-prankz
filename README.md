This is a project for setting up news pranks to trick your friends. [Check out the demo!](https://chicag0tribune.netlify.app/)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v10+ project set up to be instantly deployed to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/Bk4UicocL), using [a Next.js build plugin](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-nextjs) to server-side render routes with Netlify Functions!
